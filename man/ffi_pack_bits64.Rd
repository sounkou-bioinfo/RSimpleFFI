\title{Pack bit-fields into a 64-bit value}
\usage{
ffi_pack_bits64(values, widths)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{Integer vector of values to pack}

\item{widths}{Integer vector of bit widths for each value}
}
\value{
Packed value as double (for 64-bit range)
}
\description{
Packs multiple values into a single 64-bit integer (returned as double)
according to specified bit widths. This version uses C code for full
64-bit support.
}
\details{
Values are packed from LSB to MSB (least significant bit to most significant bit).
Each value is masked to its specified width and shifted into position.
Uses C implementation for full 64-bit support (R integers are only 32-bit).
}
\examples{
# Pack three bit-fields: enabled (1 bit), mode (3 bits), priority (4 bits)
packed <- ffi_pack_bits64(c(1L, 5L, 12L), c(1L, 3L, 4L))

# Works with values > 32 bits total
large_packed <- ffi_pack_bits64(c(1, 0x7FFFFFFF), c(1L, 31L))

}
