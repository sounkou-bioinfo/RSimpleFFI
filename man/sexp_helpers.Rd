\title{SEXP Pointer Helpers for Safe FFI Usage}
\description{
Functions for safely extracting pointers from R objects while ensuring
the R object remains protected from garbage collection.
}
\details{
When passing R objects to C functions via FFI, we need to:
\enumerate{
\item Extract the underlying pointer (SEXP or data pointer)
\item Prevent R from garbage collecting the object while we use the pointer
\item Release the protection when we're done
}

These helpers use R's \code{R_PreserveObject}/\code{R_ReleaseObject} mechanism
to prevent GC. The returned external pointer includes a finalizer that
automatically releases the protection when the pointer is no longer used.
}
