\title{Extract a signed bit-field from a 64-bit packed value}
\usage{
ffi_extract_signed_bits64(packed_value, bit_offset, bit_width)
}
\arguments{
\item{packed_value}{Packed value (as double for 64-bit range)}

\item{bit_offset}{Bit offset from LSB (0-based)}

\item{bit_width}{Number of bits in the field}
}
\value{
Extracted signed value as double
}
\description{
Extracts a bit-field and sign-extends it based on the high bit.
Useful for signed integer fields in C structures.
}
\examples{
# Pack a negative value in 4-bit signed field (-3 = 0xD in 4 bits)
packed <- ffi_pack_bits64(c(13L), c(4L))  # 0xD = -3 as signed 4-bit
ffi_extract_signed_bits64(packed, 0L, 4L)  # -3

}
